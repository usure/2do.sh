NOTE: RUN ./todo help first

OPTIONAL:
run ./install if you don't want to write: ./todo always. ^_^
2do.sh is a todo shell script. Not to be confused with the project called: todo.txt
If you want the cli version: use todo
if you want the GTk version: use todogtk.sh

For a list of things that you can do... Check out TODO.
Enjoy.

The reason there are no packages for this script is because I wanted it 
to work on all distros.  Also. I'm lazy :P

Please use quotes when you use the add command.
