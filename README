If you want the cli version: use todo.sh
if you want the GTk version: use todogtk.sh

For a list of things that you can do... Check out TODO.
Enjoy.

The file called git is a shell script I made for myself to make it eaiser to commit changes. Feel free to use it.


Note: Please do not commit files until you are sure that they are free of any major bugs.
