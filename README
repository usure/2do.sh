NOTE: RUN ./todo help first

2do.sh is a todo shell script. Not to be confused with the project called: todo.txt
If you want the cli version: use todo
if you want the GTk version: use todogtk.sh

For a list of things that you can do... Check out TODO.
Enjoy.

Also. If you want to run a 'todo server' then install: nmap
debian: sudo apt-get install nmap
arch linux: sudo pacman -S nmap
other: source.

Then run:
ncat -t -l 1234 --keep-open --sh-exec "~/2do/todo"

I also included the ncat standalone binary in the server DIR.
