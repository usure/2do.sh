NOTE: RUN ./todo.sh help first

2do.sh is a todo shell script. Not to be confused with the project called: todo.txt
If you want the cli version: use todo.sh
if you want the GTk version: use todogtk.sh

For a list of things that you can do... Check out TODO.
Enjoy.

The file called git is a shell script I made for myself to make it eaiser to commit changes. Feel free to use it.

Also. If you want to run a 'todo server' then install: nmap
debian: sudo apt-get install nmap
arch linux: sudo pacman -S nmap
other: source.

Then run:
ncat -t -l 1234 --keep-open --sh-exec "~/2do/todo.sh"


Note: Please do not commit files until you are sure that they are free of any major bugs.
